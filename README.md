# Learn Python, 30 Minutes at a Time

**Author:** Nicholas Hunt-Walker

Idea space for a project teaching Python 30 minutes at a time.
This is a living repository, so feel free to submit ideas if you have them.

The goal here is to train you up in a language to the point where you could do the job of a software developer that writes Python, with a particular slant toward web development (i.e. building websites).
Whether or not you can GET that job is a different story, but at the very least you'll have the skills to DO the job.

There's an assumption that you at least have seen a programming language before and that you know what a Terminal is.
If you're not at least at that point, this might be a struggle for you.
Otherwise, if you're at all familiar with programming, then this will hopefully be helpful in extending your CS knowledge to encompass the beautiful language of Python.

This book is written in my own "do as you talk" kind of style, so hopefully that doesn't rub you the wrong way.
All of the code snippets that are meant to be in Python files can be found in the [from the notes](./from-notes) directory, though this won't include anything written in the Python prompt or the command line so be aware.
All of the exercises that are assigned at the end of each chapter can be found in [exercises](./exercises).
I strongly recommend that you do them yourself before looking at how I did it, noting that just because I wrote my code one way and you wrote yours a different way, it doesn't mean that your code is wrong.
I am not the golden truth here, I'm just providing examples of how a program **_can_** be written.

- Start going through [the lessons](./lessons)
- Reference complete examples [from the notes](./from-notes)
- Check out the solutions to the end-of-chapter [exercises](./exercises)
