# Python, 30 Minutes at a Time

**Author:** Nicholas Hunt-Walker

Idea space for a project teaching Python 30 minutes at a time.
This is a living repository, so feel free to submit ideas if you have them.

The goal here is to train you up in a language to the point where you could do the job of a software developer that writes Python, with a particular slant toward web development (i.e. building websites).
Whether or not you can GET that job is a different story, but at the very least you'll have the skills to DO the job.
